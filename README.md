# UNDER CONSTRUCTION #
# Portfolio Page #

I built myself a place to live in the Internet!

## What is this about ? ##

This is the code for my personal portfolio page. It is a place where I can love on the internet, express myself, on what I work in my spare time and where I can also document some progress. <br>
I tried to use as much plain JS as possible, since in my opinion most frameworks are nice but not quite necessary for small projects. Also it is important to understand the underlying language so it is no waste to exercise a bit my JS. However, for the charts in the 'skills' section I used zingcharts, since it would have bursted the frame of a personal portpolio page to implement these kind of visuals. <br>
The same goes for css, though I used bulma for some buttons. Also I tried myself a bit on SCSS and it feels quite handy! <br>


### It is still under heavy construction and I try to work on it as much as I can squeeze im. ###
